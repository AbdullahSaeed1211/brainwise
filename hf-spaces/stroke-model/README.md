# Stroke Risk Prediction Model

This Hugging Face Space hosts a machine learning model for stroke risk prediction based on various health and demographic factors.

## Model Overview

- **Type**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Target**: Binary classification (stroke risk)
- **Output**: Probability of stroke risk + risk category
- **Features**: Age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, glucose levels, and more

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/predict`

Predicts stroke risk based on patient health data.

## Risk Categories

- **Very Low Risk**: < 10% probability 
- **Low Risk**: 10-20% probability
- **Moderate Risk**: 20-40% probability
- **High Risk**: 40-60% probability
- **Very High Risk**: > 60% probability

## Model Training

This model was trained on a dataset of over 5,000 patients with various health metrics and stroke outcomes. It identifies key risk factors like:

- Age
- High blood pressure
- Heart disease
- Glucose levels
- BMI
- Smoking status

## Integration with BrainWise App

This model serves as the backend for the BrainWise app's stroke risk calculator, providing users with risk assessments based on their health metrics.
